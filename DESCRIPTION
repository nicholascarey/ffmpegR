Title: Functions for interfacing with ffmpeg for common video editing tasks 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nicholas Carey
Maintainer: Nicholas Carey <nicholascarey@gmail.com>
Description: Some functions to do common video editing operations in ffmpeg through R. 
    Created these simply because I find lack of normal text entry and editing in the 
    terminal frustrating, and sometimes I just want to do it through R. Works on macOS 
    only for now. Windows support wouldn't be difficult to add, and I'll consider it if 
    anyone shows some interest.
